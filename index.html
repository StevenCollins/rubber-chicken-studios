<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="Cyber Rune R Logo.png"></p>

<p>Step into the Digital Shoes of one of the greatest Cyber-Runners of all time, 70R. Brought out of retirement to rescue his former Digi-Shaman partner, L0W_Ki, you must break into the highly secure EGG-Drasil™ Agri-Pharmaceutical network, re-acquire your old collection of Cyber-Runes, and navigate your way through the network's myriad Intrusion Countermeasure Traps. You must hurry, to find out what happened to your old partner, and why they were so deep in the EGG-Drasil™ network in the first place.
<p>Good luck, Runner. </p>

<p>[Can we put in a "Secure Lore-Server" box with a password? But the password is fake, so no matter what you type it takes you to the lore? Maybe with a "CYBER-WALL HACKED" message that comes up in red? Perhaps that is what takes you to the super retro cyber punk part of the website?]</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">And Now, Lore That Should Go On Another Page</h2>
            <p>It is the far-flung future of 1997.</p>
            <p>As the millennium draws to a close, ever-expanding Hyper-Corps controlled more and more of a dwindling Earth. As resources shrank, and greedy appetites swelled, mankind turned to technology to create its savior. Artificial Intelligence, or "A.I.".</p>
            <p>It was a disaster. </p>
            <p>Now, mankind lives in the shadow of its greatest accomplishment, brought low by the power and genius of its chosen child. Reduced to surviving in pockets of Free Signal, out of the reaches of the A.I. claws, tribes of humans scratch out a living in the hard earth, with only the barest of Bandwidth. </p>
            <p>Powerful Digi-Shamans protect these tiny enclaves, venturing forth into the grim forest of code that is the Hyper-Corp server structure to salvage data, divert power, and most importantly... to hide their people.</p>
            <p>These Code-Witches bear with them the only artifact that seems to stem the influence of the mighty A.I.s. The last vestige of a proud Humanity, the last gift of the mighty to their shattered descendants. The Cyber-Runes. </p>
            <p>Some give the Cyber-Runner great stealth on the network, others speed. Some provide a measure of control over the great Pathways. But to bring a Cyber-Rune into the network is to arouse the attention of the slumbering Beasts, and the A.I. will be quick to hunt a Cyber-Runner down. The more runes they bear, the more of a threat the A.I. considers them to be, and to bear more than 4 is to risk immediate deletion. </p>
            <p>It has been untold years, since the Rise of the Great Minds. The sky is their plaything, and counting time is no longer a surety. But one legend brings the people hope, even now, in these dark days. One tale, of a Cyber-Rune so powerful as to Excise even the A.I.s from the network.</p>
            <p>A myth.</p>
            <p>A legend.</p>
            <p>A false-hope, likely planted by the enemy to lure foolhardy Data-Mages into an early grave. </p>
            <p>But if true... It could be the end of an era of tyranny.</p>
            <p>That is why, to this day, Cyber-Runners search for the one Rune they have never found.</p>
